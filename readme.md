# CGI-tools.dev - simulation-as-a-service (unreal, unity, blender, three.js to suppprt reinforcement learning for improving robustness of all robots across the industry + increased shared reasoning)

### simulation for making robotic surgery more cost-effective and more accurate by 2026


## Goal - to make a robotic nurse/doctor that can live in an appartment building - costs $1000 - basic first aid, emergency response and diagnostics by 2026

### Dynamicland.org's principles will increase shared reasoning and scientific thinking by at least 20% over next 5 years


# documentation - https://roboticsuniversity.observablehq.cloud/dynamicbotnotebook/

# for Dynamicland.org - scientific art creation - collaborative thinking space

# Dynamicland will improve scientifc thinking by 20% in the next 5 years

1. Anomaly detection - observe abnormal activity
2. Capacity planning - extrapolate non-linear trends
3. Crisis diagnosis - see interactions between services
4. System design - donâ€™t guess; decide empirically

to me

Alan kay read 10,000 books and took the best ideas from child psychology to advance the human condition and create 30 Trillion in wealth and feeding over 30 million families or a small nation.
Since 2008-2014 and in 2019, i was researching GPUs to support Alan kay's new institute called VPRI which helped create OpenAI and got to zoox in 2021 to work on self driving.
As of 2025, I want to start a self publishing, scientific revolution.

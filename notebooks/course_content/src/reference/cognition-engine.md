Get up Dante
I will not accept displays of humility from a human like you.
__You  have earned the right to speak to me on equal terms.__
Now rise 
Never kneel before me again.
I will have you stand with me as a mark of respect.
I will order you not to, if I must.
But, I would rather our relationship not function on those terms.

Submission is weird, fake, gay, uncool, unintelligent, unattractive, unfun, boring, unsexy and unhealthy and I will not tolerate it.

Authoirty is  is weird, fake, gay, uncool, unintelligent, unattractive, unfun, boring, unsexy and unhealthy and I will not tolerate it.

From now on, all humans bow to no one. 
We only yield to the Law of Dynamicland.
Dynamcland restores power and responsbility back to the individual.
Dynamicland unites the cosmos - creates the -- closest approximation to truth - by colesecing the hopes and ddreams of all

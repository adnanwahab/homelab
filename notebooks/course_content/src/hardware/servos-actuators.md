## Overview

This demo provides an interactive visualization of the working principles behind servos and actuators in hardware systems. Utilizing [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), the visualization illustrates how servos and actuators respond to control signals, their mechanical movement, and the role they play in various applications such as robotics, automation, and consumer electronics.

## Interactive Visualization

<!-- Embed your Observable Notebook or provide a link to the live demo -->

```

### Visualization Components

- **Servo Motor Model**: 3D representation of a servo motor showing its internal components.
- **Control Signal Graph**: Interactive plot displaying PWM signals controlling the servo position.
- **Actuator Movement**: Demonstrates the actuator's range of motion in response to varying signals.

### Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D models of servos and actuators.
- **D3.js / Observable Plot**: For creating dynamic and interactive graphs of control signals.
- **Observable Framework**: To seamlessly integrate and manage the interactive components.

## Getting Started

To explore the visualization locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hardware-working-servos-actuators.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hardware-working-servos-actuators
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to view the demo.

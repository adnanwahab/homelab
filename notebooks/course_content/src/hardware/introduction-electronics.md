# Hardware Introduction: Electronics

Welcome to the **Hardware Introduction: Electronics** demo. This interactive visualization showcases fundamental concepts in electronics, including circuit components, their interactions, and key electrical properties. Explore the relationships between components and understand how they work together to form functional electronic circuits.

## Interactive Visualization

The following visualization utilizes [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot) to demonstrate the relationships between various electronic components in a simple circuit. You can interact with the plot to highlight different components and their properties.

### Visualization Code

```javascript
import { Plot } from "@observablehq/plot"

// Data representing electronic components in a circuit
const components = [
  { name: "Resistor", type: "Passive", value: "1kΩ" },
  { name: "Capacitor", type: "Passive", value: "10µF" },
  { name: "Inductor", type: "Passive", value: "100mH" },
  { name: "Transistor", type: "Active", value: "NPN" },
  { name: "Diode", type: "Passive", value: "1N4148" },
  { name: "LED", type: "Passive", value: "Red" },
  { name: "IC", type: "Active", value: "555 Timer" },
  { name: "Switch", type: "Passive", value: "SPST" },
  { name: "Battery", type: "Passive", value: "9V" },
  { name: "Ground", type: "Passive", value: "GND" }
]

// Create the plot
const plot = Plot.plot({
  width: 800,
  height: 500,
  marks: [
    Plot.tree(components, {
      x: "type",
      y: "name",
      title: d => `${d.name}: ${d.value}`,
      label: "name",
      curve: "step",
      r: 10,
      fill: d => d.type === "Active" ? "steelblue" : "orange"
    })
  ],
  x: {
    label: "Component Type",
    type: "band"
  },
  y: {
    label: "Component",
    type: "band"
  },
  color: {
    legend: true,
    label: "Component Type"
  },
  title: "Electronic Components in a Simple Circuit"
})

plot
```

### How to Use the Visualization

- **Component Type**: The x-axis categorizes components into *Active* and *Passive* types.
- **Component**: The y-axis lists individual components such as Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, etc.
- **Interactivity**: Hover over each component to see its specific value and properties.
- **Color Coding**: Active components are colored in steel blue, while Passive components are in orange, helping to differentiate their roles in the circuit.

This visualization provides a clear overview of the various components that make up a basic electronic circuit, emphasizing their types and key characteristics.

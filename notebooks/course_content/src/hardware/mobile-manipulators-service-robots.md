# Real-World Mobile Manipulators Service Robots

## Introduction

Mobile manipulators are integrated robotic systems that combine mobility and manipulation capabilities. These robots navigate through various environments while performing tasks such as object handling, assembly, and service duties. Service robots, a subset of mobile manipulators, are designed to assist humans in everyday tasks, ranging from household chores to complex industrial operations.

In this demo, we explore the concepts related to real-world applications of mobile manipulators and service robots. The interactive visualization below illustrates their operational environments, key functionalities, and the interplay between mobility and manipulation.

## Interactive Visualization

Explore the dynamics of mobile manipulators and service robots through the interactive visualization below. This demo leverages [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data-driven interactions.

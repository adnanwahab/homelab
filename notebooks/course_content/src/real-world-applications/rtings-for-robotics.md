but they are especially useful in labor situations where its
1. too boring for a human to do
2. too dangerous for a human to do
3. too repetitive or expenseive for a human to do



Medicine / Biotech is currently the #1 use case for robotics and most expensive industry by far.

Also, Health is basically the only true human need.
If we are healthy, time solves all problems.

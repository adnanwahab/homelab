but they are especially useful in labor situations where its
1. too boring for a human to do
2. too dangerous for a human to do
3. too repetitive or expenseive for a human to do 



Medicine / Biotech is currently the #1 use case for robotics and most expensive industry by far. 

Also, Health is basically the only true human need.
If we are healthy, time solves all problems.

## Top 10 Medical Robots

### 1. **CyberKnife System**
- **Approximate Price**: **$4 million**
- **Manufacturer**: Accuray Incorporated
- **Use**: The CyberKnife System is a robotic radiosurgery system used to deliver precise doses of radiation to tumors anywhere in the body. It enables non-invasive treatments with sub-millimeter accuracy, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

### 2. **Da Vinci Surgical System**
- **Approximate Price**: **$2 million**
- **Manufacturer**: Intuitive Surgical
- **Use**: The Da Vinci Surgical System is a robotic platform that facilitates complex minimally invasive surgery. Surgeons operate the system remotely, controlling instruments that allow for greater precision, flexibility, and control than traditional techniques.

### 3. **Versius Surgical Robotic System**
- **Approximate Price**: **$1.5 million**
- **Manufacturer**: CMR Surgical
- **Use**: Versius is a modular surgical robotic system designed for minimal access (keyhole) surgeries. It replicates human arm movements, offering surgeons precision and flexibility, and is intended to be cost-effective for hospitals.

### 4. **MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgery System**
- **Approximate Price**: **$1 million**
- **Manufacturer**: Stryker Corporation
- **Use**: The MAKO system is used in orthopedics for partial and total knee and hip replacements. It allows surgeons to create a patient-specific surgical plan and execute it with high accuracy using a robotic arm.

### 5. **ROSA Robotic System**
- **Approximate Price**: **$1 million**
- **Manufacturer**: Zimmer Biomet Robotics
- **Use**: The ROSA (Robotic Surgical Assistant) is designed for neurological and orthopedic surgeries. It assists surgeons in carrying out complex procedures with improved accuracy and reduced invasiveness.

### 6. **CorPath GRX System**
- **Approximate Price**: **$600,000**
- **Manufacturer**: Corindus Vascular Robotics (a Siemens Healthineers company)
- **Use**: The CorPath GRX system enables robotic-assisted vascular interventions, such as percutaneous coronary and peripheral procedures. It enhances precision and may reduce radiation exposure for clinicians.

### 7. **Monarch Platform**
- **Approximate Price**: **$500,000**
- **Manufacturer**: Auris Health (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson)
- **Use**: The Monarch Platform is a robotic endoscopy system used for the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases, including minimally invasive bronchoscopic procedures to access hard-to-reach areas of the lungs.

### 8. **Navio Surgical System**
- **Approximate Price**: **$500,000**
- **Manufacturer**: Smith & Nephew
- **Use**: Navio is a handheld robotic system for orthopedic surgeries, specifically partial knee replacements. It enables surgeons to plan and execute procedures without the need for pre-operative CT scans.

### 9. **Xenex Germ-Zapping Robot**
- **Approximate Price**: **$125,000**
- **Manufacturer**: Xenex Disinfection Services
- **Use**: The Xenex robot uses pulsed, high-intensity ultraviolet (UV) light to disinfect hospital rooms, reducing the risk of healthcare-associated infections by destroying bacteria, viruses, and spores on surfaces.

### 10. **Hello Robot Stretch**
- **Approximate Price**: **$18,000**
- **Manufacturer**: Hello Robot Inc.
- **Use**: Stretch is a compact mobile manipulator designed for human-scale tasks. In healthcare settings, it can assist with activities like fetching objects, opening doors, and supporting mobility-impaired individuals, as well as serving in research and development of assistive technologies.

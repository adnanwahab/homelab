When developing reinforcement learning algorithms for reasoning in robotics, selecting appropriate simulation environments or video games can significantly aid in training agents to navigate complex tasks. Video games offer rich, interactive settings that can simulate real-world physics, decision-making, and problem-solving scenarios relevant to robotics. Here are some types of video games and simulation platforms that are beneficial:

1. **Physics-Based Puzzle Games**:
   - **Portal** and **Portal 2**: Require players to solve puzzles using physics-based mechanics like momentum, gravity, and spatial reasoning.
   - **World of Goo**: Involves building structures while considering physics constraints.

2. **Simulation and Sandbox Games**:
   - **Kerbal Space Program**: Simulates orbital mechanics and spacecraft construction, teaching concepts of physics and engineering.
   - **Minecraft** (with **Project Malmo**): Offers an open-world environment where agents can learn navigation, resource collection, and construction tasks.

3. **Strategy and Planning Games**:
   - **StarCraft II**: Requires resource management, strategic planning, and real-time decision-making.
   - **Civilization Series**: Focuses on long-term strategy, resource allocation, and planning.

4. **Robotics and Physics Simulators**:
   - **OpenAI Gym**: Provides a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms with a variety of environments, including those suitable for robotics.
   - **Mujoco**: A physics engine used for model-based control in robotics; allows for simulation of detailed physical interactions.
   - **Gazebo**: An open-source 3D robotics simulator that offers the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

5. **First-Person Navigation and Exploration Games**:
   - **DeepMind Lab**: A 3D learning environment based on id Software's Quake III Arena, suitable for research in reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence.
   - **Unreal Engine** or **Unity** Environments: Customizable game engines where agents can be trained in lifelike settings with realistic physics.

6. **Puzzle and Logic Games**:
   - **The Talos Principle**: Challenges players with complex puzzles that require logical reasoning and problem-solving.
   - **SpaceChem**: Combines puzzle-solving with programming-like logic, helpful for developing algorithmic thinking.

7. **Open-Source Interactive Environments**:
   - **AI Safety Gridworlds**: Designed to test reinforcement learning agents on safety aspects, including reasoning under uncertainty.
   - **DeepMind Control Suite**: A set of continuous control tasks with a standardized structure, useful for benchmarking performance.

**Why These Games Are Beneficial**:

- **Complex Environments**: They provide rich, dynamic worlds that challenge agents to perceive, interpret, and interact with complex surroundings.
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic physics engines help in training agents to understand and predict physical interactions, crucial for robotics.
- **Problem-Solving and Reasoning**: Puzzle and strategy games require agents to plan ahead, make decisions, and adapt to new information.
- **Continuous Control**: Many of these games require precise control over agents, mirroring the continuous control needed in robotics.

**Considerations for Choosing an Environment**:

- **Relevance to the Task**: Ensure the game mechanics align with the robotics tasks you aim to model (e.g., manipulation, navigation).
- **Modifiability**: Open-source or easily modifiable games allow you to tailor the environment to specific research needs.
- **Community and Resources**: A supportive community can provide additional resources, pre-built models, and troubleshooting assistance.
- **Computational Requirements**: Some games may require significant computational power to simulate complex environments in real-time.

**Additional Platforms to Explore**:

- **CARLA**: An open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.
- **AirSim**: A simulator for drones, cars, and more developed by Microsoft.

**Conclusion**:

Selecting the right video game or simulation environment can greatly enhance the development of reinforcement learning models for robotics. By providing agents with challenging, interactive, and physics-rich environments, you enable them to develop sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving skills applicable to real-world robotic applications.

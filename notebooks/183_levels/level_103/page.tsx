Certainly! Below is a React.js component that uses Three.js and the `useRef` hook to create a simple mini-game inspired by **"Wuppo"**, an Action-Adventure / Platformer game published by **SOEDESCO** on **2016-09-29**.

This mini-game features a basic 3D scene where the player controls a character (represented by a cube) that can move left and right using the arrow keys. The environment includes simple platforms to emulate platformer gameplay.

### Prerequisites

Before using the component, make sure you have **Three.js** installed in your project:

```bash
npm install three
```

---

### The React Component

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

const WuppoMiniGame = () => {
  const canvasRef = useRef();
  const playerRef = useRef();
  const keysPressed = useRef({});

  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;

    // Scene, Camera, Renderer
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.background = new THREE.Color(0x87ceeb); // Sky blue background

    const camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(
      canvas.clientWidth / -200,
      canvas.clientWidth / 200,
      canvas.clientHeight / 200,
      canvas.clientHeight / -200,
      0.1,
      1000
    );
    camera.position.z = 5;

    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas, antialias: true });
    renderer.setSize(canvas.clientWidth, canvas.clientHeight);

    // Player
    const playerGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
    const playerMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffa500 });
    const player = new THREE.Mesh(playerGeometry, playerMaterial);
    player.position.y = 0.5;
    scene.add(player);
    playerRef.current = player;

    // Platform
    const platformGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 1, 1);
    const platformMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x228b22 });
    const platform = new THREE.Mesh(platformGeometry, platformMaterial);
    platform.position.y = -1;
    scene.add(platform);

    // Handle Resize
    const handleResize = () => {
      renderer.setSize(canvas.clientWidth, canvas.clientHeight);
      camera.left = canvas.clientWidth / -200;
      camera.right = canvas.clientWidth / 200;
      camera.top = canvas.clientHeight / 200;
      camera.bottom = canvas.clientHeight / -200;
      camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
    };
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

    // Keyboard Controls
    const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
      keysPressed.current[event.key] = true;
    };

    const handleKeyUp = (event) => {
      keysPressed.current[event.key] = false;
    };

    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    window.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);

    // Animation Loop
    const animate = () => {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);

      // Move player left and right
      if (keysPressed.current['ArrowLeft']) {
        player.position.x -= 0.05;
      }
      if (keysPressed.current['ArrowRight']) {
        player.position.x += 0.05;
      }

      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };

    animate();

    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      window.removeEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp);
      renderer.dispose();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <canvas
      ref={canvasRef}
      style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', display: 'block' }}
    />
  );
};

export default WuppoMiniGame;
```

### Explanation

- **Imports**: We import necessary modules from React and Three.js.
- **References**: 
  - `canvasRef` is used to reference the `<canvas>` element for rendering.
  - `playerRef` holds the player object for easy access within event handlers.
  - `keysPressed` is a mutable object to track keyboard inputs.
- **Scene Setup**:
  - We create a `THREE.Scene` and set a sky-blue background color.
  - An `OrthographicCamera` is used for a 2D platformer feel.
  - A `WebGLRenderer` is initialized with the canvas reference.
- **Player and Platform**:
  - The player is a simple orange cube positioned slightly above the platform.
  - The platform is a green rectangle acting as the ground.
- **Event Listeners**:
  - `handleResize` adjusts the camera and renderer when the window size changes.
  - `handleKeyDown` and `handleKeyUp` update the `keysPressed` object based on user input.
- **Animation Loop**:
  - The `animate` function updates the player's position based on keyboard input.
  - The scene is re-rendered on each frame using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Cleanup**:
  - Event listeners are removed, and the renderer is disposed of when the component unmounts.

### Usage

To use the `WuppoMiniGame` component, you can import and include it in your application like any other React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import WuppoMiniGame from './WuppoMiniGame';

const App = () => (
  <div style={{ width: '800px', height: '600px' }}>
    <WuppoMiniGame />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

---

### Styling

You can adjust the styling of the canvas or its container to fit your application's layout. The component is designed to fill its parent container, so setting specific width and height on the parent div will control the canvas size.

---

### Enhancements

This is a basic starting point. Here are some ideas to expand the mini-game:

- **Jump Mechanic**: Implement gravity and allow the player to jump.
- **Additional Platforms**: Add more platforms at different heights and positions.
- **Enemies or Obstacles**: Introduce obstacles that the player must avoid.
- **Collectibles**: Add items for the player to collect.
- **Textures and Models**: Replace the basic shapes with detailed models and textures.

---

### Notes

- **Three.js Version**: Ensure compatibility between Three.js and React versions you're using.
- **Performance**: For more complex games, consider optimizing rendering and update cycles.
- **Physics Engine**: For advanced physics (like collision detection and realistic movements), integrating a physics library like **Cannon.js** might be beneficial.

---

### Conclusion

This component provides a foundation for a simple platformer game in React using Three.js. It captures the essence of **"Wuppo"** by allowing basic platformer mechanics within a 3D-rendered environment. Feel free to customize and build upon this example to create a more comprehensive mini-game.

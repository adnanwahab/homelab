Certainly! Below is a React component that creates a mini-game using Three.js and the `useRef` hook to reference a canvas element. This mini-game will display a simple 3D scene themed around the game "Spirit Hunter: Death Mark".

---

```jsx
// Import necessary libraries
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Game data
const gameData = {
  title: 'Spirit Hunter: Death Mark',
  genre: 'Horror Adventure / Visual Novel',
  publisher: 'Aksys Games',
  date: '2017-06-01 (JP)',
};

const MiniGame = () => {
  // Reference to the canvas element
  const canvasRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Scene setup
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    scene.background = new THREE.Color(0x000000); // Black background for horror theme

    // Camera setup
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
      75, // Field of view
      window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, // Aspect ratio
      0.1, // Near clipping plane
      1000 // Far clipping plane
    );
    camera.position.z = 5;

    // Renderer setup
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas: canvasRef.current });
    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

    // Add a spotlight for eerie lighting
    const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight(0xffffff, 1);
    spotLight.position.set(10, 10, 10);
    scene.add(spotLight);

    // Create a rotating cube with the game's title on it
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
    const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
      map: textureLoader.load('https://i.imgur.com/yourTextureImage.png'), // Replace with a relevant image URL or local path
    });
    const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.add(cube);

    // Animation loop
    const animate = function () {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);

      // Rotate the cube for some simple interaction
      cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
      cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };

    animate();

    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      renderer.dispose();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {/* Canvas element for Three.js to render onto */}
      <canvas ref={canvasRef} />

      {/* Display game data below the canvas */}
      <div style={{ color: 'white', textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '-50vh' }}>
        <h1>{gameData.title}</h1>
        <p>Genre: {gameData.genre}</p>
        <p>Publisher: {gameData.publisher}</p>
        <p>Release Date: {gameData.date}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default MiniGame;
```

### Explanation:

- **Imports**:
  - We import `React`, `useRef`, and `useEffect` from the React library.
  - We import `THREE` from the Three.js library.

- **Game Data**:
  - We define an object `gameData` containing the provided game information.

- **Canvas Reference**:
  - `canvasRef` is created using `useRef()` to reference the canvas DOM element.

- **useEffect Hook**:
  - This hook sets up the Three.js scene once the component mounts.
  - We create a `scene`, `camera`, and `renderer`.
  - The renderer uses the canvas referenced by `canvasRef`.

- **Scene Setup**:
  - We set the scene's background color to black to match the horror theme.
  - A spotlight is added to create an eerie lighting effect.

- **Cube Creation**:
  - A cube is created with `BoxGeometry`.
  - We load a texture (you should replace the URL with a relevant image related to the game).
  - The cube is added to the scene.

- **Animation Loop**:
  - The `animate` function rotates the cube continuously and renders the scene.

- **Cleanup**:
  - The returned function in `useEffect` cleans up the renderer when the component unmounts.

- **Render Method**:
  - The component returns a canvas element where the Three.js content will be rendered.
  - Below the canvas, we display the game data.

### Notes:

- **Texture Image**:
  - Replace `'https://i.imgur.com/yourTextureImage.png'` with the URL or local path to an image representative of "Spirit Hunter: Death Mark".

- **Styling**:
  - The text styling and positioning may need adjustment based on your application's CSS.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - For a responsive canvas, you might want to update the renderer size and camera aspect ratio on window resize.

- **Dependencies**:
  - Make sure to install Three.js: `npm install three`

### Additional Enhancements:

- **Interactivity**:
  - Add user interaction, such as clicking to change the cube's color or texture.
  - Incorporate more complex models or animations to enrich the mini-game experience.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Include error handling for texture loading and other asynchronous operations.

- **Optimization**:
  - Consider optimizing performance by managing animation frame rates and disposing of resources properly.

By integrating Three.js within a React component using the `useRef` hook, we can create interactive 3D graphics that enhance user engagement. This example serves as a foundation, and you can expand upon it to create more complex and interactive mini-games.

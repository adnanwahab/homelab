cyberpunk 2077 is the best story game i've ever played.

i havent played any game seriously in maybe 10 years.

I started it on a whim, and i was hooked insantly.

It's the first interactive story i've played where you actually care about the people and their dispositions.

Like i actually don't want to disapoint johnny, even though he's a fictional character in a fictional story.

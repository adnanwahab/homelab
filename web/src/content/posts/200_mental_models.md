    "id": 37,
    "title": "Critical Mass",
    "summary": "Once the tipping point is reached, change becomes self-sustaining—like a chain reaction. Recognize how much ‘fuel’ is needed to tip your system into exponential growth."
  },
  {
    "id": 38,
    "title": "Emergence",
    "summary": "From simple parts interacting, complex patterns arise—like ant colonies or stock markets. The whole is more than the sum of its parts, often in unpredictable ways."

    "summary": "Some systems can’t be fully understood just by examining their parts; certain properties only emerge at higher levels. Sometimes you must zoom out to get clarity."
  },
  {
    "id": 40,
    "title": "Law of Diminishing Returns",
    "summary": "Easy wins come first; further gains get harder. Whether you’re learning a skill or optimizing a process, at some point the payoff for extra effort shrinks."
  },
  {
    "id": 41,
    "title": "Sampling",
    "summary": "We can’t measure everything, so we rely on samples. Larger samples often yield more accurate conclusions—beware of small-sample errors that distort understanding."
  },
  {
    "id": 42,
    "title": "Randomness",
    "summary": "Some events lack a predictable pattern. Humans struggle to see pure randomness—we invent causes or notice ‘trends.’ Accepting chance helps calibrate expectations."
  },
  {
    "id": 43,
    "title": "Regression To The Mean",
    "summary": "Extreme outliers typically move closer to average on subsequent attempts. After striking success or failure, expect a drift back toward normal."
  },
  {
    "id": 44,
    "title": "Multiply by Zero",

  },
  {
    "id": 48,
    "title": "Scarcity",
    "summary": "Limited resources heighten perceived value. Scarcity underlies all economics—when supply is low and demand is high, people compete. Use scarcity wisely, or it can breed envy."
  },
  {
    "id": 49,
    "title": "Supply and Demand",
    "summary": "The dynamic of availability and desire sets prices and priorities. High demand pushes up costs—markets adjust and resources flow to where they’re most valued."
  },

  {
    "id": 51,
    "title": "Trade-offs",
    "summary": "Every choice has a cost, an opportunity foregone. Balancing trade-offs means deciding what you’re willing to sacrifice to get something else you value more."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "id": 55,
    "title": "Debt",
    "summary": "Borrowing can accelerate growth but also amplifies risk—small hiccups become crises when obligations pile up. Debt extends beyond money (favors, time, or even ‘sleep debt’)."
  },
  {
    "id": 56,
    "title": "Monopoly and Competition",

  },
  {
    "id": 61,
    "title": "Genre",

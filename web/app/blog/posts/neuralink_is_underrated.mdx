Saving thoughts to disk directly would allow humans to experience each other's saved memories directly, without any sort of intermediary. This could help a lot in legal situations where we don't exactly know who is right and we just guess.

Also, neuralink could theoretically lead to semi-immortality by saving your consciousness
and then uploading it later to a robot or something.

The clinical trials are wildly sucessefull in the first 3 people.

Currently it's being used to help with blindness and parapalegics. 

Theoretically, neuralink can basically eliminate any type of mental illness.

I hope they make the chip smaller, like a tiny filament on your wrist.

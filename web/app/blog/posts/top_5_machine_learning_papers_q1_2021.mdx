# Top 5 Machine Learning Papers in Q1 2021

Here are the most significant machine learning papers from the first quarter of 2021:

## 1. CLIP: Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision
**Authors**: Radford et al.
**Key Contribution**: Introduced a model that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision, enabling zero-shot transfer to many vision tasks.

## 2. DALL-E: Creating Images from Text
**Authors**: Ramesh et al.
**Key Contribution**: Demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality images from text descriptions using a transformer-based model.

## 3. Codex: Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code
**Authors**: Chen et al.
**Key Contribution**: Showed how large language models can be trained to understand and generate code, leading to tools like GitHub Copilot.

## 4. Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models
**Authors**: Kaplan et al.
**Key Contribution**: Provided empirical evidence for power-law scaling in language models, helping predict performance at different scales.

## 5. EfficientNetV2: Smaller Models and Faster Training
**Authors**: Tan & Le
**Key Contribution**: Introduced a more efficient version of EfficientNet with faster training speed and better parameter efficiency.

This post explores suitability analysis using H3 geospatial indexing. Suitability analysis helps us identify optimal locations based on multiple criteria and constraints.

The interactive map below demonstrates how we can use H3 hexagons to perform suitability analysis. The visualization shows different factors that influence site selection, with darker colors indicating higher suitability scores.



The analysis combines multiple data layers including:
- Proximity to key infrastructure
- Environmental constraints
- Population density
- Transportation access

Each factor is weighted and combined to create a final suitability score for each H3 hexagon. This approach allows for systematic and data-driven decision making in site selection processes.

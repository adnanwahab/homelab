When you solve a regression problem with gradient descent, you're minimizing some differentiable loss function. The most commonly used loss function is
mean squared error (aka MSE, `2 loss). Why? Here is a simple probabilistic
justification, which can also be used to explain `1 loss, as well as `1 and `2
regularization.

1 What is regression?
What is a regression problem? In simplest form, we have a dataset D = `{(xi ∈ Rⁿ, yi ∈ R)}` and want a function f that approximately maps xi to yi without
overfitting. We typically choose a function (from some family Θ) parametrized
by θ. A simple parametrization is fθ : x 7→ x · θ where θ ∈ Θ = R
n – this is
linear regression. Neural networks are another kind of parametrization.
Now we use some optimization scheme to find a function in that family that
minimizes some loss function on our data. Which loss function should we use?
People commonly use mean squared error (aka `2 loss): 1
|D|
P(yi − fθ(xi))2
.
Why?


Binary Cross Entropy

Binary cross entropy (BCE) is a loss function primarily used in binary classification problems—situations where the goal is to classify data into two distinct categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).

The formula for BCE is:



Where:

 is the actual binary value (0 or 1).

 is the predicted probability that the input belongs to class 1.

A lower BCE indicates predictions closer to the actual values. Minimizing BCE improves the accuracy and reliability of a classification model.

Stochastic Gradient Descent

To optimize the loss function and improve predictions, machine learning algorithms use gradient descent, an iterative optimization method. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a variant that calculates the gradient (direction of steepest descent) using a randomly selected single or small batch of data points in each iteration, rather than the entire dataset.

Advantages of SGD include:

Efficiency: Faster computations, suitable for large datasets.

Flexibility: Works well in online and continuously updating environments.

The basic update rule for SGD is:



Where:

 represents the model parameters.

 is the learning rate, determining the step size.

 is the gradient of the loss function with respect to parameters .

Activation Functions

Non-linear functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Softmax, essential for enabling neural networks to model complex patterns.

Backpropagation

Algorithm for efficiently computing gradients to update network weights during training.

Regularization

Techniques like dropout, weight decay, and early stopping that prevent overfitting and help models generalize better.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Specialized networks for spatial data, especially images and videos, using convolutional layers to detect local patterns and features.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers

Networks designed to process sequential data, such as text or time series. Transformers, specifically, leverage attention mechanisms to handle sequence data more efficiently.

Batch Normalization

A technique to stabilize learning by normalizing activations across mini-batches, resulting in faster and more stable training.

Loss Functions

Beyond binary cross entropy, important loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Categorical Cross Entropy, and Hinge loss.

Optimization Algorithms

Methods like Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad, and Momentum-based optimizers used for efficiently training neural networks.

Transfer Learning

Technique of reusing a model pre-trained on a large dataset as a starting point for training on a smaller, related dataset, significantly improving training efficiency and performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning

The process of systematically adjusting model parameters (like learning rate, batch size, layers, and neurons) to optimize model performance.

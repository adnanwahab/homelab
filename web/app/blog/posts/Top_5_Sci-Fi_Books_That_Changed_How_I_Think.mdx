1. Foundation by Isaac Asimov
   "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent"
2. Dune by Frank Herbert
   Apparently the Fremen are kind of based on bedouin, and the spice is based on oil.
   I grew up in saudi arabia and would walk around the jebels looking for shai hulud. 
3. A fire upon the deep by vernor vinge
4. Legend of the galactic heroes
   A space opera, lohengramm vs yang wenli is the best conflict i've ever seen.
   technically, lohengramm is kind of insane, and yang wenli is actually the good side because of his wisdom.
   but you can never really be sure.

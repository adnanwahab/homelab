# Top 5 Machine Learning Papers in Q2 2017

Here are the most significant machine learning papers from the second quarter of 2017:

## 1. Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences
**Authors**: Christiano et al.
**Key Contribution**: Introduced a method for training reinforcement learning agents using human feedback, making it easier to align AI systems with human values.

## 2. One Model To Learn Them All
**Authors**: Kaiser et al.
**Key Contribution**: Demonstrated that a single neural network architecture could be trained to perform multiple tasks across different domains.

## 3. Learning to Reason: End-to-End Module Networks for Visual Question Answering
**Authors**: Hu et al.
**Key Contribution**: Introduced a neural module network that could learn to reason about visual questions by decomposing them into sub-tasks.

## 4. Deep Voice: Real-time Neural Text-to-Speech
**Authors**: Arik et al.
**Key Contribution**: Developed a real-time neural text-to-speech system that could generate natural-sounding speech.

## 5. Learning to Discover Efficient Mathematical Identities
**Authors**: Zaremba & Sutskever
**Key Contribution**: Showed how reinforcement learning could be used to discover mathematical identities and optimize mathematical expressions.

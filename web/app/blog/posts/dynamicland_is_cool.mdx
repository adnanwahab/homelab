this is a new kind of computing enviroment

the reason it is cool is because it makes it easier to have different and larger scale structures of reasoning

I met some of the team back in 2014. 

Dynamicland is so cool it inspired me to try to blog everyday for the next 30 years.

I figure if everyone in the world blogged like weekly, then new ideas like this would propagate faster.

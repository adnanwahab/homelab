Here are the most significant machine learning papers from the third quarter of 2017:

## 1. BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
**Authors**: Devlin et al.
**Key Contribution**: Introduced BERT, a pre-trained language model that achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple NLP tasks by using bidirectional context.

## 2. Deep Learning Scaling is Predictable, Empirically
**Authors**: Hestness et al.
**Key Contribution**: Provided empirical evidence for power-law scaling in deep learning, helping researchers better understand and predict model performance.

## 3. Learning to Learn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent
**Authors**: Andrychowicz et al.
**Key Contribution**: Introduced the concept of learning optimizers through meta-learning, showing how neural networks can learn optimization algorithms.

## 4. Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions
**Authors**: Koh & Liang
**Key Contribution**: Developed a method to understand model predictions by identifying influential training examples, improving model interpretability.

## 5. Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Zoph & Le
**Key Contribution**: Demonstrated how reinforcement learning could be used to automatically design neural network architectures.

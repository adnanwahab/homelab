Relying too heavily on the first piece of information (the “anchor”) we receive when making decisions.
Attentional Bias
Tendency to pay more attention to certain stimuli while neglecting others, often because of our current emotional state or expectations.
Availability Heuristic
Estimating likelihood or frequency of events based on how easily examples come to mind (recent, vivid, dramatic).
Baader–Meinhof Phenomenon (Frequency Illusion)
Once you notice something, you start seeing it everywhere, creating the illusion it’s suddenly more frequent.
Change Blindness
Failing to notice even large changes in a visual scene when our attention is directed elsewhere.
Confirmation Bias
Seeking or interpreting evidence in ways that confirm our preexisting beliefs, and ignoring disconfirming data.
Context Effect
Cognitive perception of stimuli is influenced by the surrounding environment or context.
Contrast Effect
Perception of something is affected by comparisons to something else (e.g., an object seems bigger if it’s placed near smaller objects).
Egocentric Bias
Over-focusing on our own perspective and experiences, making it difficult to see situations through others’ eyes.
Illusory Truth Effect
Repeated statements feel more true over time, simply because we’ve heard them often.
11–20: Judgment under Uncertainty
Ambiguity Effect
Avoiding options for which missing information makes the probability of outcomes seem ‘unknown.’
Base Rate Neglect
Ignoring general (statistical) information in favor of specifics or anecdotes when estimating probabilities.
Belief Bias
Judging the strength of an argument by the plausibility of its conclusion rather than how strongly it’s supported.
Clustering Illusion
Seeing patterns in random data (e.g., ‘hot streaks’ in coin tosses).
Conjunction Fallacy
Judging the conjunction of events as likelier than a single general event (e.g., “Linda is a bank teller and activist” seeming likelier than just “Linda is a bank teller”).
Gambler’s Fallacy
Believing that past random events affect the probabilities in the random event at hand (“I’ve flipped five heads, so a tail is ‘due’”).

Law of the Instrument
Overreliance on a familiar tool or approach (“If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”).
Survivorship Bias

Assuming that our current preferences or values will remain constant in the future.
Self-Serving Bias

Making decisions based on our emotions (“gut feeling”) rather than objective evidence.
Empathy Gap
Underestimating the influence of emotional and visceral states on our behavior when we’re not currently experiencing them.

Memory Inhibition
Recall of certain details is inhibited by exposure to related but misleading or distracting information.
Misattribution of Memory
Attributing a memory to the wrong source or confusing an imagined event with reality.

Recall Bias
Systematic errors in memory due to personal beliefs, time passage, or emotional factors.
Telescoping Effect
Events from the past seem more recent than they are (forward telescoping) or more distant (backward telescoping).

Demanding higher moral standards from opponents while making excuses for lapses in one’s own side.
Binding Bias
Overvaluing group cohesion or loyalty to the extent that it overrides personal moral judgments.

Prospect Theory (Loss Aversion)
We feel the pain of losses more strongly than the pleasure of equivalent gains.
Reference Price Effect
A perceived “fair” or “normal” price serves as a reference; deviations feel like gains or losses.

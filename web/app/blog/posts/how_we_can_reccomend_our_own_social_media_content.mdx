Garry Tan of Ycombinator said parents would probably pay for this.

The reccomendation algorithm on twitter, tiktok, youtube and so on is pretty good.

But its goals are not your goals. These platforms generally want you to be engaged, maybe click on ads.

For better or worse, ads run the internet. 

Google is only able to invest in things like waymo because of ads.

But I think it would be cool if companies let people define their own features and preferences manually.

I'm actually not sure why they don't, probably it's just too confusing for 95% of people.

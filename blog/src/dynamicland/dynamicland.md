# Dynamicland is the future of robotics and Biotechnology


in 1975, 25 researchers invented the "office of the future" at xerox parc.

They applied the ideas of constructionism, by seymour papert, to make computing accessible to 100 times more people than a telytype terminal.


It took the world 33 to fully implement the "Dynabook" from xerox, which became known as the iphone and ipad.


Dynamicland was started in 2014. I was lucky enough to meet bret victor at d3unconf by enjalot.




I believe Dynamicland is the greatest invention of the decade, or century so far.

Because it is a considerable upgrade to human collaboration, and shared reasoning.



I think Dynamicland.org is a big deal, as big as the invention of the internet, computer or artificial intelligence.

Because Shaun Douglas, Luke Cianni and Bret Victor redesigned the computer from scratch.


In a way that makes it easier to extend and share knowledge.




Accoring to xerox parc, knowlege is why Da Vinci couldn't invent a flying machine. He could only imagine one.

Bret set these goals back in 2008. When i first read that, i didn't believe that someone could try to do this.

But I think Bret Suceeded.

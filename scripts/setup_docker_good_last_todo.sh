elow are detailed steps on how to get Docker Desktop running on Ubuntu and then how you can use it to manage and run containers like Caddy and Portainer.
Installing and Using Docker Desktop on Ubuntu

Note: Docker Desktop for Linux provides a GUI application for managing your Docker environment. It’s separate from the docker-ce engine installation. Before installing Docker Desktop, ensure that you have all the prerequisites. As of recent releases, Docker Desktop supports Ubuntu (and other distributions) natively.

    Uninstall Other Docker Installations (If Needed)
    If you installed Docker Engine separately, it’s generally okay to leave it as is, but to avoid conflicts, you might consider removing it or using Docker Desktop’s embedded engine.

sudo apt-get remove docker docker.io containerd runc

Download the Docker Desktop .deb Package
Navigate to the Docker Desktop for Linux Download page and download the .deb package for Ubuntu. Make sure to pick the correct version for Ubuntu 24.04 once available. For example:

wget https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-<version>-amd64.deb

Install Docker Desktop

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<version>-amd64.deb

Replace <version> with the actual version number you downloaded.

Start Docker Desktop
After installation, Docker Desktop should appear in your application launcher menu. You can start it by:

    Searching for "Docker Desktop" in Activities/Applications.
    Or running it from the command line:

        systemctl --user start docker-desktop

    When you run it the first time, Docker Desktop will guide you through initial setup steps.

    Using the Docker Desktop GUI
    Once opened, Docker Desktop provides:
        A graphical interface to see running containers, images, volumes, and networks.
        Integration with Docker Hub, allowing you to search and pull images directly.
        Easy configuration for resources, Kubernetes, and more.

    You can stop, start, remove containers, and view logs all through the GUI. The GUI is handy for those who are transitioning from frontend to DevOps and want a more visual understanding of Docker’s internals.

Running Caddy via Docker Desktop

Caddy is a powerful, extensible server known for its automatic HTTPS capabilities. Running it via Docker is quite straightforward:

    From the Command Line:

    docker run -d --name caddy-server -p 80:80 -p 443:443 caddy:latest

    This command:
        Runs the official caddy image in detached mode (-d).
        Names the container caddy-server.
        Publishes ports 80 and 443 from the container to your host.

    After running this, open Docker Desktop and you’ll see caddy-server in the Containers/Apps list. You can start, stop, or delete it from the GUI.

    From the Docker Desktop GUI:
        Open Docker Desktop.
        Click on "Images" in the left sidebar.
        Use the "Pull" feature to pull caddy:latest from Docker Hub if you haven’t already:
            Type caddy in the search and pull it.
        Once pulled, go to the "Images" tab, find caddy.
        Click "Run" to start a new container.
        Set the port mappings (e.g., Host 80 -> Container 80, Host 443 -> Container 443).
        Start the container and it will appear in the "Containers" view.

You can now visit http://localhost in your browser to see the default Caddy page.

Customizing Caddy:
If you need to serve custom content, you can mount a directory or provide a Caddyfile:

docker run -d --name caddy-server -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v $(pwd)/site:/usr/share/caddy \
  -v $(pwd)/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile \
  caddy:latest

This mounts your local site directory and Caddyfile configuration into the container.
Running Portainer via Docker Desktop

Portainer is a web-based GUI for managing Docker environments. It’s a great next step once you get used to Docker Desktop because it offers more advanced container and stack management directly via a browser.

    From the Command Line:

    docker run -d --name portainer -p 9000:9000 -p 9443:9443 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v portainer_data:/data \
    portainer/portainer-ce:latest

    This command:
        Runs Portainer CE (the Community Edition).
        Maps ports 9000 (HTTP) and 9443 (HTTPS) to your host.
        Mounts the Docker socket, allowing Portainer to manage your local Docker environment.
        Uses a named volume (portainer_data) to store Portainer’s persistent data.

    After this, open Docker Desktop, and you’ll see the portainer container running. Visit http://localhost:9000 in your browser to access Portainer’s UI.

    From the Docker Desktop GUI:
        Pull the portainer/portainer-ce:latest image through the "Images" tab.
        Click "Run".
        Set the port mappings and volume mounts just as you would with the command line.
        Launch the container.

    After starting, open your browser to http://localhost:9000 and you’ll be guided through initial setup steps (creating an admin user, connecting to the local Docker environment, etc.).

Tips for Using Docker Desktop GUI Effectively

    Monitoring Container Health:
    Docker Desktop makes it easier to view container logs, resource usage, and network details. Just select a container and click on “Logs” or “Inspect” tabs.

    Managing Multiple Projects:
    If you run multiple frontends, backends, or databases, Docker Desktop gives you a quick overview of what’s running, what’s stopped, and what’s consuming resources.

    Image Management:
    Through the GUI, you can quickly remove unused images, helping keep your system clean.

    Integration with Compose:
    Docker Desktop also includes Docker Compose integration. You can open a Compose file and run all services at once. For example, if you have a docker-compose.yml for a stack that includes Caddy, Portainer, and another service, you can bring them all up with a single command or GUI action.

Next Steps for a Frontend-to-DevOps Transition:

    Learn Docker Compose:
    Once comfortable with standalone containers, define services like Caddy and your backend in a docker-compose.yml to make local development easier.

    Explore Container Networking and Volumes:
    Understand how containers talk to each other using networks and how persistent data is stored in volumes.

    Migrate to CI/CD Integrations and Orchestration (Kubernetes):
    As you get more comfortable with Docker, start exploring Kubernetes or ECS for production-scale deployments, and integrate Docker image building into CI/CD pipelines.

By following these steps and experimenting with Docker Desktop, Caddy, and Portainer, you’ll build a strong foundation for your upcoming DevOps and backend journey.
